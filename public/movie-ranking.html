<h1>The Best Movies According to Amanda</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>This movie holds an extraordinary place in my heart because it was the first movie
   that I saw in theaters at the age of 9. I am not a huge dinosaur enthusiast but
   the movie stands the test of time and children of all ages love it.
</p>
<h3>Moulin Rouge</h3>
<p>Set in the 1890s during the French Art Revolution, this musical is both a love story
   and an experience of art, music, and culture from a time long forgotten. Understanding the
   undertones of the movie and the struggles of the people in this period only makes the 
   journey that much better.

<h3>Anything Star Wars</h3>
<p>Offering a healthy dose of Sci-Fi and culture, these films are cult classics. It is a lesson in the
   idea of totalitarian rule and human nature to rebel against oppression. I am a huge fan of the story and 
   watch everything related to them. There are some arguments of cannon vs. non-cannon material but I enjoy 
   sharing my passion for the library of material and engaging new fans in exploring the universe created by Lucas.
