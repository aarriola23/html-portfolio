<h1>The Best Movies According to Amanda</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>This movie holds a very special place in my heart because it was the first movie
   that I saw in theaters at the age of 9. The movie itself still stands the test of 
   time and children of all ages love it.
</p>
<h3>Moulin Rouge</h3>
<p>Set in the 1890's during the French Art Revolution, this musical is both a love story
   and an experience into art, musicals and culture for a time long ago.
</p>
<h3>Anything Star Wars</h3>
<p>Offering a health dose of Sci-Fi and culture, these films are cult classics. I am a 
   huge fan of the story and watch everything related to them. I enjoy sharing my 
   passion for the library of material and engaging new fans.
